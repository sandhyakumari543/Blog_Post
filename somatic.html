        <p class="font1">
            Somatic therapy, also known as somatic experiencing therapy, is a therapy that aims to treat PTSD and other
            mental and emotional health issues through the connection of mind and body. This body-centric approach works
            by helping to release stress, tension, and trauma from the body.
            <br>
            <br>
            Unlike standard mental health therapy, such as CBT which focuses prominently on the mind, somatic therapy
            incorporates body-oriented modalities such as dance, breathwork, and meditation to support mental healing.
            In addition, somatic experiencing therapy sessions include talk therapy and mind-body exercises.

        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h2 class="blogpost-meta">Types of Somatic Therapy</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="font1">
            The most common and straightforward form of somatic therapy is known as such or as somatic experiencing
            therapy.
            In this therapy, patients discuss their problems as in other forms of mental wellness therapies. Rather than
            just talk about them, somatic therapists guide patients to focus on their underlying physical sensations.
            From
            there, the mind-body exercises may include breath work, meditation, visualization, massage, grounding,
            dance,
            and/or sensation awareness work.
            <br>

            Beyond the standard somatic therapy, numerous subgroups use its framework in specific ways. These include:
            <br>
            <br>
        <ul style="margin-left: 77px; margin-right: 77px;">
            <li>Sensorimotor psychotherapy1: A comprehensive therapy that uses the body as both a source of information
                and
                intervention targets.</li><br>
            <li>The Hakomi Method2: Psychotherapy that integrates scientific, psychological, and spiritual sources,
                focusing on
                four core concepts: gentleness, nonviolence, compassion, and mindfulness.</li><br>
            <li>Bioenergetic analysis3: Body-psychotherapy that combines bodily, analytic, and relational work based on
                understanding energy.</li><br>
            <li>Biodynamic psychotherapy4: A combination of allopathic (medical) and holistic therapy modalities that
                include
                physical massage by the practitioner</li><br>
            <li>Brainspotting: In addition to mind and bodywork, this therapy incorporates eye positioning to retrain
                emotional
                reactions.</li><br>

            Somatic therapy operates off the idea that what happens to you in your life is stored not only in your mind
            but also in your body. By focusing on both the physical sensations in your body and the discussion of your
            problems, it is a comprehensive approach to therapy. Somatic therapy techniques include:
            <br>
            <br>
        <ul style="margin-left: 77px; margin-right: 77px;">

            <li> Developing more awareness of your body and its sensations</li><br>
            <li> Calling upon emotional resources</li><br>
            <li> Grounding</li><br>
            <li> Encouraging detailed descriptions</li><br>
            <li> Movement, including acting out of physical feelings</li><br>
            <li> Learning tools to calm oneself</li><br>
            <li> Alternating focus between something stressful and something not stressful to help release tension</li>
            <br>
            <li> Replaying past situations with new physical tools</li><br>
            <li> Emotional release</li><br>

            What Somatic Therapy Can Help With
        </h2>
        <p class="font1">
            Anyone can try somatic therapy as an alternative to conventional talk therapy. It is used for a variety of
            mental and physical health issues.
            <br>
            <br>

            Mental health issues that somatic therapy is used for include:

            <li> PTSD</li><br>
            <li> Anxiety</li><br>
            <li> Addiction</li><br>
            <li> Grief</li><br>
            <li> Depression</li><br>
            <li> Stress</li><br>

            <br>
            Physically, somatic therapy may assist with:

            looking to get more in touch with themselves and their experiences in life.
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2 class="blogpost-meta">
        Effectiveness</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="blogpost-meta">Somatic therapy has been shown to be an effective form of therapy for numerous psychiatric and physical
        issues.</p><br><br>
        <h2 class="blogpost-meta">
            Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="font1">
            Treatment for PTSD with somatic experiencing has been proven to be an effective method to speed up the time
            needed to heal from a traumatic event.
<br>
            Initial studies of somatic therapy5 have found it to be an effective treatment for PTSD, noting, "mixed
            model linear regression analysis showed significant intervention effects for posttraumatic symptoms severity
            (Cohen's d = 0.94 to 1.26) and depression (Cohen's d = 0.7 to 1.08) both pre‐post and pre‐follow‐up."
<br>
            In other words, somatic therapy may be an effective therapy method for PTSD, although further research is
            needed to understand what specific patients will benefit most from this type of treatment.
<br>
            When victims of a tsunami were studied6, the results stated, "90% of participants reported significant
            improvement or being completely free of symptoms of intrusion, arousal, and avoidance. The results support
            the effectiveness and reliability of this modified version of Somatic Experiencing Therapy in working with
            trauma reactions."

                Chronic Pain</h2>
                <br>
               <p class="font1">It might seem surprising to some people that a form of psychotherapy can help with physical pain, but it
                has
                shown to be the case. In one study7, Somatic therapy was proven effective as a treatment for cervical
                myofascial pain, and the effectiveness was not increased when acupuncture was added.

                Things to Consider</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="font1">
                As with any form of therapy, it's essential to be in an emotional and mental place where you have the
                time
                and energy to process complex feelings. If you're doing somatic therapy in person, touch is often
                involved. <br>
                Because of that, it's wise to ensure you don't mind being touched by another person.

                Boundaries and consent play vital roles in touch, and you will never be touched without consent.

                Somatic therapy is not considered to have any risks that are specific or unique to its format.

                <h3 class="blogpost-meta">
                    Find a Therapist</h3>
                <br>

                <p class="blogpost-meta">
                The first step to starting somatic therapy is to find a therapist in your area. Depending if you want to
                see
                someone in person or virtually, you may need to look for someone doing telehealth. If you're looking for
                an
                in-person experience so that you also receive the benefits of touch-oriented treatments, add your
                location
                into a search engine field along with your query.

                Somatic therapy is common enough that you should be able to find one in most major cities. If you're
                looking
                for a virtual therapist, check online to make sure that your potential therapist has positive reviews.

                It's important to note that most somatic therapists do not work directly with health insurance companies
                because somatic therapy is considered an alternative form of therapy. Many are licensed marriage and
                family
                therapists (MFTs), psychologists, or other licensed therapists and may be able to provide you with a
                superbill to submit to your insurance company yourself for reimbursement.
                <br><br>
                <h3 class="blogpost-meta">
                    Prepare for Your First Appointment</h3><br>
                    <p class="font1">
                Before your first appointment, think through your emotional and physical goals and what you want to
                accomplish through the therapy. As with any therapy, be aware that you may bring up old and painful
                memories. These are good to have distilled to tell your therapist about.

                If you are seeing someone in person, prepare yourself for potential healing work conducted via touch.
                Whether virtual or in-person, your somatic therapist will ask you questions about your history and
                therapy
                goals during your first session. The two of you will work together to discuss what the therapy will look
                like and how you will proceed. What matters most is that you are comfortable with the therapist.
                <br>
                <br>

                As with all therapies, somatic therapy may be emotionally difficult and take a long journey, though many
                people find a deeper level of healing than they could achieve through other therapies.
