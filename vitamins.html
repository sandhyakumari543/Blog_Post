            Don’t we all want to do what we can to reduce the impact of age-related decline on our memory?
            <br><br>
            Millions of people take a multivitamin each day. Some believe it's a sort of insurance in case their diet is
            missing some essential nutrient. Others believe it will ward off disease by boosting immunity, improving
            brain health, or regulating metabolism. It's easy to see where these ideas come from: ads tout wide-ranging
            health benefits, even though most offer little or no evidence to back up the claims.

        <h1 class="blogpost-meta">Can a daily multivitamin improve cognition in older adults?</h1>
        <img src="img/vit.png" alt="" class="blogpost-meta">
        <p class="font1">
            <br>Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias affect more than 46 million people worldwide. Safe and
            affordable
            treatments to prevent cognitive decline in older adults are urgently needed. In response to this need,
            certain
            dietary supplements have been touted as having protective effects on cognition.
            <br><br>
            Normal brain function requires various vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. Deficiencies in these
            nutrients
            may increase the risk for cognitive decline and dementia with age. Yet clinical trials of individual
            nutrients’
            effects on cognition have yielded mixed results. Prior research suggests that flavanols in particular —
            compounds found in high levels in unprocessed cocoa — might benefit cognition.
            <br><br>
            Much of the research on flavanols was based on observational studies, rather than clinical trials. And
            previously, the effects of a multivitamin on cognition in older adults had been studied only in a few short
            clinical trials (less than 12 months) and a single longer trial that included older male physicians.
            <br><br>
            An NIH-funded research team led by Drs. Laura Baker and Mark Espeland at Wake Forest University School of
            Medicine aimed to fill the gaps in our understanding of these supplements’ effects on cognition. They
            examined
            more than 2,200 participants, ages 65 and older, who enrolled in the study from August 2016 to August 2017.
            The
            participants’ average age was 73.
            <br><br>
            Participants were given a cocoa extract supplement and/or a multivitamin-mineral supplement daily for three
            years, or an inactive placebo for comparison. They completed a battery of cognitive tests over the phone at
            the
            beginning of the study and once a year afterward. The researchers evaluated participants on global cognition
            (a
            wide range of cognitive measures), memory, and executive function (attention, planning, and organization).
            Results appeared in the journal Alzheimer’s & Dementia on Sept. 14, 2022.
            <br><br>
            The team found no difference in global cognition between those who took cocoa extract and those who did not.
            But
            participants taking the multivitamin had higher global cognition scores than those who didn’t. The
            improvement
            was most pronounced in those with a history of cardiovascular disease. Significant improvements with daily
            multivitamin use were also seen in memory and executive function. Cocoa extract had no effect on either.
            <br><br>
            The results suggest that a safe and affordable daily multivitamin-mineral supplement might improve cognition
            in
            older adults or protect cognitive health with age. Yet the researchers caution that the results, while
            promising, are still preliminary.
            <br><br>
            “It’s too early to recommend daily multivitamin supplementation to prevent cognitive decline,” Baker says.
            “While these preliminary findings are promising, additional research is needed in a larger and more diverse
            group of people. Also, we still have work to do to better understand why the multivitamin might benefit
            cognition in older adults.”
            <br><br>
            A new study suggests a daily multivitamin and mineral supplement is a simple and inexpensive way to help
            older adults slow the decline in some aspects of memory function.

        <h1 class="blogpost-meta">Should we all be taking multivitamins?</h1>
        <p class="font1">
            This study alone isn't enough to suggest routine use of multivitamins for people of all ages. It may turn
            out that the benefits for older adults seen in this study were due to deficiencies in certain nutrients
            among some of the study participants. We don't know if this is true because it wasn't part of the study.
            <br><br>
            Or we might learn that the benefits reported here are too small to make much difference in real
            life, or wane over time, or have no effect on preventing common types of dementia. And it's hard to ignore
            an earlier randomized, placebo-controlled trial that was actually larger and longer-term: it found no
            improvement in brain function among male physicians ages 65 and older taking multivitamins.
            <br><br>
            But it does mean that more study is warranted. We need to understand who is most likely to benefit from
            multivitamin use, what dose is optimal, and what parts of the multivitamin are most important. We also need
            trials that are larger, last longer, and include a more diverse group of participants. And certainly,
            there's a difference between improving cognitive function and preventing dementia. We still need to know if
            conditions like Alzheimer's disease can be prevented by multivitamin use or other supplements.
